# COMPARATIVE-ANALYSIS-ON-FMCG-SECTOR
Risk and Return Analysis of FMCG and Consumer Durables Sectors

Project Title:

A Comparative Study of Risk and Return in FMCG and Consumer Durables Sectors

Project Description:

This project aims to analyze the risk and return characteristics of selected FMCG and Consumer Durables companies in India. By evaluating financial performance, stock market trends, and investment potential, the study provides valuable insights for investors, financial analysts, and policymakers. The research leverages statistical tools and financial models to understand the investment viability and sectoral performance of these industries.

Objectives:

Compare historical returns of selected Consumer Durables and FMCG stocks over a specific time period.

Evaluate the risk levels associated with selected stocks using statistical measures like standard deviation and beta.

Identify significant differences in return patterns between Consumer Durables and FMCG stocks.

Assess if there is a consistent relationship between risk and return within each sector.

Dataset:

Financial data sourced from industry reports, regulatory filings, and financial databases such as Yahoo Finance, Money Control, and Screener.

Market indices used for benchmarking risk and return comparisons.

Sample size: 10 companies (5 FMCG and 5 Consumer Durables firms).

Methodology:

Data Collection: Historical financial data for selected companies.

Risk Calculation: Standard deviation and beta analysis.

Return Calculation: Expected returns using probability-based and non-probability models.

Comparative Analysis: Assessing financial performance across the two sectors.

Findings & Interpretation: Identifying investment opportunities and risk mitigation strategies.

Tools & Technologies Used:

Microsoft Excel for data analysis and visualization.

Statistical models for risk-return calculations.

Financial research and industry reports.

Key Findings:

FMCG stocks tend to be less volatile with stable returns, making them a safer investment during economic downturns.

Consumer Durables stocks show higher volatility but provide greater returns in a strong economic climate.

A well-diversified portfolio should include a mix of both sectors to balance risk and optimize returns.

Limitations:

Market conditions are dynamic, and historical data may not always predict future trends.

Certain industry-specific risks may not be fully captured in the study.

Limited dataset may not represent the entire sector performance.

Future Scope:

Expanding the study to include more companies for broader analysis.

Using advanced machine learning techniques for predictive modeling.

Analyzing the impact of macroeconomic factors on risk-return dynamics.
